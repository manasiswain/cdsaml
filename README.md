Sentiment analysis or opinion mining makes use of natural language processing to determine the emotions conveyed through a text. 
Through sentiment analysis, one can determine the intent behind the text which could be positive, negative or neutral. 
Sentiment analysis has a wide range of applications like social media monitoring, customer support management, brand monitoring, product analytics, etc. 
Sentiment analysis plays an important role in analysis of social media text messages.Social media texts along with emojis are influenced in a tremendous way because of the use of sarcasm. 
Understanding the real intent of the user behind the text is vital. In general, sarcasm is expressed by different polarities of the text and emojis used. 
I have implemented a model based on this concept that detects sarcasm when messages have different text and emoji polarities.
